# future-star-network

To hop the stars, we need analysis of the network. This is a theoretical survival guide to stellar flights.

## Introduction

I have been reading [this post about stellar navigation](http://allthingsgraphed.com/2014/12/05/stellar-navigation-using-network-analysis/). The author analyzed some properties of stellar leapfrog network.

This post inspires me to work out a more realistic leapfrog or even trading network analysis. In some sense a stellar leapfrog/trading network is much simpler than networks on the Earth. We travel to avoid mountains, chart certain courses on the ocean on the Earth. Among the stars, as long as we can travel a certain distance, we find no obstacle from on star to another but straight flights.

So do it.
